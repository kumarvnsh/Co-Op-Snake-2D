## Gameplay
The objective is to control your snake, avoid the opponent, and grow longer by eating "Mass Gainer" food items. Be careful not to collide with your opponent or the obstacles, as that can end the game for you. Additionally, consuming a "Mass Burner" food item will decrease your snake’s length, adding a strategic element to the gameplay.
